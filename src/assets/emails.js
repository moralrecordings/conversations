            <p>All,</p>
            <p>Welcome to the Allied Brands family! It's good to have you on board.</p>\n<p>If you aren't fully across them yet, now would be a good time to revisit the Corporate Mission Statement and Core Company Values. As a steward of Allied Brands Inc's social media presence, <b>you</b> are the company's public representative and a first point of contact for many of our customers.</p>
            <p>For your first week of on-the-job training you will be given access to one social media feed: the KingsleyÂ® Snacks promotional account (<b>@kingsleysnacks</b>). Please engage with as many KingsleyÂ® Snacks customers as possible; whether it be to refer them to our amazing customer service team, or just to compliment them on their great taste in treats!</p>
            <p>Some tips to help you get started:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All interaction with customers is handled through our form-based ticketing system, Alwynsoft IssueMagic. Tickets in IssueMagic are drawn from a number of social media sources, including @ mentions, direct messages and mentions of specific keywords.</li>
                <li>When a ticket shows up in IssueMagic, click on it to expand the answer form. Answering a ticket in IssueMagic will send a response back to the customer; it's easy as that!</li>
                <li>When preparing a response to a customer, it is important that it arrives to them from the <b>correct brand account</b>. You can change the active account using the button group on the right side of the IssueMagic interface.</li>
                <li>We wouldn't expect you to respond to every query that arrives in on a given day. That said, the business has reasonable expectations for KPIs such as <b>weekly response totals</b>. You can keep track of these metrics using the gauges on the left side of the IssueMagic interface.</li>
                <li>All responses you make to customer queries are verified by a supervisor before release. Any noted mistakes will be flagged with a <b>formal warning</b>, which you should review to help avoid future mistakes.</li>
                <li>Repeated warnings may result in performance management or disciplinary proceedings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's about it, best of luck and have fun! Our customers really are the best. <span style=\"font-family: serif;\">&nbsp;J</span></p>
            <p>(if you haven't yet signed and emailed back the Standard Work-For-Hire Contract and Standard Contractor Non-Disclosure Agreement, please do so ASAP as they are needed by payroll!)</p>

            <p>All,</p>
            <p>Following a "lessons learned" analysis of last month's surprise loss in court, we are rolling out sweeping changes to our business procedures. In short, although an incident had been reported to the company through social media and a response issued, it was not escalated to the Customer Settlement Response team in time, by which point other related externalities had convinced the affected customer to file suit. We were unlucky that the plaintiff was unusually well resourced to bring about their case.</p>
            <p>As a precaution to avoid this same confluence of events, we have added a new marker to the ticketing system. In future, please mark any messages wherein the author makes specific demands or legal threats to a business unit with the <b>"Litigious"</b> flag; these threads will be monitored by CSR for possible early settlement talks.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>

            <p>You probably don't know me, I used to be the social media manager for ABI. Sorry for the unsolicited email, I got your contact info from a friend still working for the Beast.</p>

            <p>Basically, in case you haven't picked up on it there's no long-term prospects for the job. ABI hired some teenage fucks from the Bay Area to "train" some neural AI thing with what you're doing, which they intend to set loose on the public again as soon as they figure out how to make it stop talking like a Nazi. You probably heard about the last time their social media account was on the news? Yeah, that happened a few days after me and my team were fired and replaced with version 1. </p>

            <p>What makes me fucking livid is this unpaid internship horseshit. Okay, the job wasn't great money, but it was at least a salary. I am 99% sure that their game plan is to ditch you at the end of the trial period and just churn people until they have enough data or whatever to switch CyberGoebbels back on. Obviously you're free to do as you wish, but I figure the least I can do is warn you about what's going down.</p>

            <p>Cheers,<br/>Andrea</p>

            <p>Heya,</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying back. I respect your decision, but I still think you're being played for a chump. Don't get me wrong, I do get that it's a really shit job market right now, but please promise me that you'll look for other positions. This isn't just me being bitter or the free work scam; Allied is seriously a fucked up place. The business is running at a loss, the leadership is an endless buck-passing circlejerk, and everyone is being pushed to cut corners. Jesus, they actually used the word "dissent" to justify cracking down on managers and quality control supervisors doing their job! I can't make this shit up.</p>

            <p>But yes, lots of mistakes are being made and good people are being pressured to quit. I probably shouldn't go into old gossip, but in a nutshell I do not use Allied Brands products, nor would I recommend them to anyone wishing to live to a ripe old age. Mark my words, one day there will be a public scandal, and it will be big enough that your job description will change to "human sewer rake". I would not wish that horrorshow on anyone.</p>

            <p>Cheers,<br/>Andrea</p>

            <p>It has come to the attention of the Legal team that a small number of Excelsior Pharmaceuticals customers are expressing despair at a perceived inability to procure our products for themselves or their loved ones. Without question, the welfare of all our customers should come first and foremost in everything we do. As good corporate citizens and as Americans, we have a duty to look beyond what is best for our image or bottom line, and provide help to those who need it the most. It's time for us to open up our moral compass and chart a new, righteous course.</p>

            <p>For any customer you would identify as "<b>at-risk</b>", please refer them to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline for assistance. This should be done from the Allied Brands Inc. corporate account (<b>@alliedbrandsinc</b>) ONLY, so as not to conflate this serious issue with the light-hearted tone used for advertising/social media outreach by the individual brands.</p>
