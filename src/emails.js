            <p>All,</p>
            <p>Welcome to the Allied Brands family! It's good to have you on board.</p>\n<p>If you aren't fully across them yet, now would be a good time to revisit the Corporate Mission Statement and Core Company Values. As a steward of Allied Brands Inc's social media presence, <b>you</b> are the company's public representative and a first point of contact for many of our customers.</p>
            <p>For your first week of on-the-job training you will be given access to one social media feed: the KingsleyÂ® Snacks promotional account (<b>@kingsleysnacks</b>). Please engage with as many KingsleyÂ® Snacks customers as possible; whether it be to refer them to our amazing customer service team, or just to compliment them on their great taste in treats!</p>
            <p>Some tips to help you get started:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All interaction with customers is handled through our form-based ticketing system, Alwynsoft IssueMagic. Tickets in IssueMagic are drawn from a number of social media sources, including @ mentions, direct messages and mentions of specific keywords.</li>
                <li>When a ticket shows up in IssueMagic, click on it to expand the answer form. Answering a ticket in IssueMagic will send a response back to the customer; it's easy as that!</li>
                <li>When preparing a response to a customer, it is important that it arrives to them from the <b>correct brand account</b>. You can change the active account using the button group on the right side of the IssueMagic interface.</li>
                <li>We wouldn't expect you to respond to every query that arrives in on a given day. That said, the business has reasonable expectations for metrics such as <b>weekly response totals</b>. You can keep track of these KPIs using the gauges on the left side of the IssueMagic interface.</li>
                <li>All responses you make to customer queries are verified by a supervisor before release. Any noted mistakes will be flagged with a <b>formal warning</b>, which you should review to help avoid future mistakes.</li>
                <li>Repeated mistakes may result in performance management or disciplinary proceedings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>That's about it, best of luck and have fun! Our customers really are the best. <span style=\"font-family: serif;\">&nbsp;J</span></p>
            <p>(if you haven't yet signed and emailed back the Standard Work-For-Hire Contract and Standard Contractor Non-Disclosure Agreement, please do so ASAP as they are needed by payroll!)</p>
            <p><span style=\"color: darkblue; font-family: serif; line-height: 1em;\">Kind regards,<br/><b>Tricia Huxton</b><br/>Public Relations Coordinator<br/><img src=\"`+ require('./assets/logo.svg')+`\"><br/>111 Electric City Ave.<br/>Scranton, PA 18509<br/>Ph: 570-330-0000 (ext 3519)<br/>Fax: 570-330-9000</span><br/><br/><small style="color: darkgreen; font-family: serif; line-height: 1em;">ðŸŒ³&nbsp;&nbsp; Please consider your carbon footprint before printing this email<small></p>
